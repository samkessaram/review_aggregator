We had the feasting menu and boy was it a feast. Everything we had was so delicious and everyone was impressed. There were 7 of us and there was so much food that we had leftovers the next day. <br><br>Every review seems to rave about the food because it's great. I would like to also point out how attentive the staff was during our time there. Someone out of our group is allergic to shellfish so she couldn't have the oysters we ordered for the table, The team at S+B made a special appetizer just for her without our request. Another thing I remember was how we never felt rushed. There was a lot of food but the timing was just so we had enough time to digest, have a some drinks and chat before the next course arrived. And each time the servers arrived with food, the group got excited and were wowed by the dishes that were laid before us :))<br><br>Thank you Chef and Skin+Bones team for another memorable night.</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

The concept, atmosphere and staff were wonderful, but the meal simply did not deliver. <br><br>My three dinner companions and I shared the family style meal at 38 dollars a pop. The first course was two small plates of flavoured green beans - simple, underwhelming, but we were still hopeful. The next round were a peanut tinged beet salad, which also small, was more flavourful but ultimately minimalist. The next dish of deep fried cheese balls were the most satisfying of the night - but with only 4 on a dish, we desired more. Lastly, the meal was rounded out with gnocchi and some steak. All of the food was passable, but not exciting, and, because the portions were small, we were left feeling a little ripped off. Two of us had to buy snacks AFTER the meal to satiate ourselves. <br><br>It pains me to write this because the staff were so lovely but the food just didn't represent.</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

Well, it is what it is and it's expected that's why it's call brunch and not a quickie (for all those who complain about brunch service at restaurants being slow :P )<br><br>Anyhow, let's get down to business. This place is downright delicious! The flavours are a creative mix of the modern and classic cuisine. You will find your classics like eggs benedict, hash, pancakes..etc But they are all paired with new age twists; such as corn hash with duck confit for example. The flavours are just harmonious.<br><br>Food aside, I have to give huge shoutout to their coffee. Great coffee from Pilot Roasters! As a self proclaimed caffeine connoisseur, I really appreciate establishments that pay attention to their drinks -- after all, it is half your meal!<br><br>The atmosphere is cool and inviting with a rustic vibe. The service is attentive and polite.<br><br>The only quibble I have is the portion size in relation to their price. You don't exactly get what you pay for but then again I think I have just been spoiled by so many other brunch places in the area with mammoth portions.<br><br>Definitely a worthy brunch place among the many elite brunch establishments in the area.</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

It was one of those weekends that I just didn't feel like standing in line. Ends up we wouldn't have needed a reservation anyway because there were a few tables available when we walked in.<br><br>First they have good coffee so they won me over immediately. They also were quickly on hand when refills were needed. We also ordered the pastry plate to share. I hesitated because I don't eat that much pastry and it was only two of us. I did not regret the decision (although we did just take almost the whole thing home). I tried the buffalo yogurt granola for breakfast and was not super taken with it. My dining partner had the chicken and waffles, which he declared delicious (but perhaps a bit heavy on the 5-spice powder). The side of bacon we ordered was fine. It was just bacon so you can't go wrong, but somehow I thought they would have extra good bacon ... <br><br>With so many brunch options in the city (or even in this neighborhood), it wouldn't be my first choice but it is a good decent brunch.</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

It's pretty trendy inside without being scene-y. It's at the end of the stretch of Queen East that's lined with restaurants and bars...so it avoids being overcrowded. <br><br>As you can imagine from the name, the place is stripped down but stylish. Rustic, industrial, dressed in neutrals and candlelight. The front dining room is quite small with a few windowside tables. The bar connects the restaurant to the rear dining room, and is quite long and very romantic-appearing. In the summer, the front dining room is quite preferable because the breeze and light are inspiring, but in the winter I can imagine the darker and more cozy dining area in the back (away from the door!) being more appealing. I'd go here just to sit at the bar. The collection of spirits and wine were impressively showcased in a beautiful wooden display shelf. <br><br>We went with the chef's tasting menu for $38 pp, which is kind of fun on one hand, but maybe not on the other hand if there are certain things on the menu you definitely want. Everything is priced reasonably. The tasting started out with the croquettes and kale + smoked salmon salad. Both were phenomenal. The croquettes could have used a tad more flavor, but the salad was remarkable. The amount of flavor that was infused into each bite of kale blew me away; slightly tart and also salty. Perfectly complemented the salmon. The charred green beans were next, and they probably were the highlight of the meal for me. The beans were done to perfection, with some sea salt and a small amount of smoky char on the surface. They lay on top of a romesco sauce that puzzled me with its deliciousness. Typically made from red tomatoes, Romesco has never been on my radar as a fave, but this puree was different: roasted green tomatoes, olive oil, almonds and bread crumbs were combined into a a thick sauce that was just bursting with flavor. I couldn't get over it! Definitely order this! Our next dish was the pork and ricotta meatballs. They were good. I wasn't ready to wet my pants over them like the green beans, though. The biggest letdown was the main dish - the cornish hen with serrano peppers, chorizo and corn. The chorizo and corn mix was AWESOME. The cornish hens, meh. Kind of bland themselves. I wish they'd offered us two entrees for the Chef's tasting instead of one. Dessert was sticky toffee pudding. <br><br>In all, this restaurant excels on many levels. I was excited by how unique some of the flavors were. The atmosphere hit my [1;35m\"[0m[31mdate night[1;35m\"[0m[31m ideal on the head: casual, stylish, relaxed and full of air + light.

This was an awesome first start because I am really not a fan of the telephone (once upon a time I used to work as a clinical counselor and I had to speak to clients on the phone--had enough phone interaction to last me a life time!) Lisa stated that for groups of 8 or more we had to go with their Brunch Feasting Menu. Further, all the menu items were going to be served on boards and platters, shared by the whole table. The menu would cost $25/ adult plus $3 if we wanted to add the Ploughman's Buffet.<br><br>So how was it?<br><br>Phenomenal! I was worried that there would not be enough food. Yes, I know that the Ploughman's Buffet was all-you-can-eat, but from the pictures I had seen online, it did not seem like there were a lot of options. Wrong!<br><br>Here is the breakdown of the awesomeness (ok, cheesy--but it was awesome!):<br><br>The service was impeccable. They never let our coffee or water reach the 25% mark. They were always on point refilling our drinks. I forgot how nice it feels to not have to chase staff down for more coffee or water.<br><br>Our table did not lack food. They did not want any of us to get up and walk over to the buffet table (which at first annoyed me to be honest), but they made sure they brought it all to us in platters to pass around among us. The staff would come around and ask, [1;35m\"[0m[31mis there anything else you would like me to get for you? Would you like more cold cuts? I see you are low on cheddar, would you like some more?[1;35m\"[0m[31m<br><br>We were not rushed. I thought we would have a limited time with the buffet before we got our hot dishes, but no, they let us lead and choose the pace. So we did what most people want to do when they are having brunch on a Sunday afternoon--have a chill leisurely experience with friends while enjoying good food. In this case, an array of delicious food options.<br><br>The food options seemed endless. Specially when you discovered that certain cheeses went great with certain jams. I am certain I annoyed my guests with all my experimentation, but seriously, after I shoved some of my experiments in their mouths, they agreed! It was good!<br><br>Before the mains came out, the staff asked what they could take away. This was huge for me because I hate when we are still eating, and plates are removed without permission or inquiry. This happens a lot when it is all-you-can-eat. Not here. I got to hold on to some cheese and the bread pudding--aww that sinfully good bread pudding (I took a piece home with me. Shhh don't tell anyone).<br><br>Holy mother of God! The mains! They weren't kidding when they called it a FEAST! We did not know where to put the platters! We had to make [1;35m\"[0m[31mTetris-like[1;35m\"[0m[31m moves to make it all fit.<br><br>Fried chicken: moist, tender, well-balanced spices, crispy exterior, a little too fatty in some parts, but then that is what some of my guests loved about it. Overall, it was pretty damn good.<br><br>Potato salad: not many people had it because it was under the chicken, which was great for me because I took it home as left-overs and I just ate it for dinner. It was delicious. I specially liked the dill.<br><br>Pancakes: Lisa was not kidding when she said that they make some of the best pancakes in Toronto. The pancakes were served with Chantilly cream, strawberries and butter. Heavenly.<br><br>Pulled Porchetta eggs Benny: someone remarked on how perfect the Hollandaise sauce was. The only flaw was that I thought the pork needed a little bit more seasoning.<br><br>Bacon: someone stated that it was the best bacon they have ever had. Hard to disagree.<br><br>Crispy potatoes: I ate a whole bowl (there were several thank God!). No joke. Crispy exterior with a fluffy interior and homemade ketchup. Oh yeah, I devoured them.<br><br>Dropping one star because....<br><br>ADDENDUM: Returned to Skin+Bones for brunch, but this time we did not do the feast, but instead we ordered from the menu. This is how the experience differed...<br><br>1. Your meal does not come with a side. <br><br>2. The Ploughman's buffet will change for every brunch. I was really looking forward to the bread pudding which they had the last time I was there, and this time it was not available.<br><br>3. Â In less than two weeks they changed the price from $3 to $5. However, if you do not add the Ploughman's buffet, I really doubt that you will get full on just the main.<br><br>BREAKDOWN:<br>$12 FOR PANCAKES (ONE OF 2 CHEAPEST ITEMS ON THEIR MENU)<br>$6 FOR POTATOES<br>$3 FOR COFFEE<br>$5 FOR THE PLOUGHMAN'S BUFFET<br>______________________<br>$26 BEFORE TAXES AND TIP Â (SUBTOTAL)<br>$33.28 WITH TAX AND TIP (IF YOU WERE TIPPING 15%)<br><br>The food is still awesome, but just keep the differences in mind. :)</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

Then promptly shown to our table in the massive and yet cozy feeling dining room in the back. Finally a place with space in the east end. Add to that, awesome 20 ft high ceilings remaining from what I recall was an auto parts warehouse prior to becoming this gem. <br><br>I would highly recommend the tasting menu. My only suggestion for the restaurant is to ask the diners if there is something on the menu they really want or need; aka some pasta for our kid. They did send over potato bites once they noticed our child wasn't eating. <br><br>I love the wave of bars and restaurants crashing into queen east and Skin and Bones has found the right balance of fun casual, meets elegant executed dining. Bottom line, Support this place. It's good.</p><p class=[1;35m\"[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
