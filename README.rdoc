Oh, Snap! is a side project I built to keep my skills fresh. At its heart it's a simple web scraper, so that means a lot of fun data manipulation with Ruby to get from the raw html to what I wanted to display to the user. Then I worked on creating a smooth user interface and getting more accustomed to CSS and JQuery/JavaScript.

I got the idea for the site at an old restaurant job. I would often look up our reviews to see what people were saying (and if there was any feedback I could use to improve). It was really annoying having to click around to a bunch of different sites to get the whole overview, and I was shocked that there wasn't a service to aggregate everything. Once I started building this project and reading Terms of Use documents, I figured out why. Needless to say, I won't be commercializing this. (Please don't sue me, OpenTable.)
